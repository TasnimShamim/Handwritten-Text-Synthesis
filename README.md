# Handwritten Text Synthesis ✍️

This project generates human-like handwritten text using deep learning models.
This project focuses on generating realistic handwritten text using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture inspired by Alex Graves’ paper “Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks.” The model learns to produce smooth, human-like handwriting by predicting pen stroke sequences conditioned on textual input.

## Features
- Sequence modeling using RNN / LSTM
- Character-level text generation
- Realistic handwriting synthesis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
2. Train the model
3. Generate handwriting samples
